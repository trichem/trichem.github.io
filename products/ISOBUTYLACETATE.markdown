description: Isobutyl Acetate is a medium boiling solvent with a typical mild, fruity, ester odor. It resembles n-butyl acetate and methyl isobutyl ketone in solvent performance and can be used as a replacement for these solvents in many formulations. Its combination of good solvent activity, desirable evaporation rate, and pleasant odor enables it to be used in a wide range of coating applications.
