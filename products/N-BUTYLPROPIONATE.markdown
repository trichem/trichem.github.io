description: N-Butyl Propionate is a non-HAP, slow evaporating, and urethane grade solvent with good solvent activity for most coating resins. In lacquers and ambient cure enamels, this solvent is used as a retarder solvent. Its slow evaporation rate allows for flow and leveling but does not prevent the quick rubbing and sanding of the lacquer. Many resins are letdown in a solvent thinning tank to make handling, storing, and shipping easier. N-Butyl Propionate is useful as a letdown solvent because of its low volatility, good solvent activity, and urethane grade quality.Since n-Butyl Propionate is not on EPA's HAP list, it is a good choice for replacing xylene in coating applications such as high-solids thermoset enamels. It is also used as a processing solvent for high-solids acrylic resins, and for coatings applied via electrostatic spray equipment.
