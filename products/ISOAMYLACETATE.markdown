description: Isoamyl acetate is used for the preparation of many synthetic flavours from apple to pi√±a colada and even coffee,
    Flavour production is the main area of application for Isoamyl acetate,
    Over 40 flavours involve the use of Isoamyl acetate,
    <br>It plays an important part in all beers and is part of the overall flavour profile. <br> It is produced by yeast during fermentation for this application and is present at low levels (typical 1.4mg/l). <br>Isoamyl acetate is an important solvent being able to dissolve nitrocellulose ester gum vinyl resin coumarone resin rosin frankincense dama resin mountain resin and castor oil. <br> It was extensively used in the aircraft industry for stiffening fabric flying surfaces as the carrier for the nitrocellulose and now retains this application in model aircraft only. <br> It can be used as solvent for chromium determination photography printing and dyeing and as an extraction agent of iron cobalt and nickel. <br> As Isoamyl acetate has a strong pleasant odour and low toxicity it can be used to test effectiveness of gas seals such as in respirators. <br> Isoamyl acetate is also used in cosmetics primarily in nail varnish application and removal because of its good solvency. <br>It is also used in deodorants and non-powered air fresheners.
