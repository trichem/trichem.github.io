description: N-Propanol (n-propyl alcohol), a three-carbon straight chain oxo alcohol, is a medium boiling, colorless liquid that is widely used in flexographic and other printing ink applications. It has a very mild odor, similar to that of ethanol and is completely soluble in water. It is useful in organic synthesis, as a chemical intermediate, and as a coating solvent. N-Propanol helps balance the drying and flow characteristics in a variety of surface coating applications.
